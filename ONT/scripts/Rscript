## Read distribution histogram
## Calculating N50

The N50 value is the length for which the cumulative size of all sequences of that length or longer represents at least 50% of the total size of all sequences.
```{r}
##-------------------------1. Histogram

histoPlot_01 <- ggplot(rawdata_readLength,aes(x=read_length))+
    geom_histogram(binwidth = 500)+theme_classic()+
    geom_vline(xintercept = 5000,color="blue")+
    lims(x=c(-250,longest_read))  +
  annotate("text", x = 15500, y = Inf, vjust = 5, label = "rRNA length", color = "blue") 



##-------------------------2. Here we calculate the which amount half of the sequencing output is 
rawdata_readLength$Cumsum_forward <- cumsum(rawdata_readLength$read_length)
rawdata_readLength$Cumsum_reverse <- max(rawdata_readLength$Cumsum_forward) - cumsum(rawdata_readLength$read_length)

Half_sequencing_output <- max(rawdata_readLength$Cumsum_forward)/2

print(paste0("The total number of sequenced bases is ",max(rawdata_readLength$Cumsum_forward)," and half of that is ",Half_sequencing_output))

##-------------------------3. Here we plot the histogram and the cumulative summary

cumSumPlot_01 <- ggplot(rawdata_readLength,aes(x=read_length,y=Cumsum_forward))+
    geom_point()+theme_classic()+
    geom_vline(xintercept = 5000,color="blue")+
    geom_hline(yintercept = Half_sequencing_output,color="red")+
    labs(y="Cummulative read length")+
    lims(x=c(-250,longest_read))


```




```{r}
ggplot(rawdata_readLength) + geom_boxplot(aes(y=read_length))

ggplot(rawdata_readLength, aes(x = 1, y = read_length)) +
    geom_jitter(alpha=0.03) +
    geom_violin(alpha=0.5) 

ggplot(rawdata_readLength) + geom_histogram(aes(x=read_length))
ggplot(rawdata_readLength) + geom_density(aes(x=read_length))
